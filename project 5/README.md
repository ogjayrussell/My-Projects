### Problem Statement
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides counseling services for persons who seek guidance with housing issues or topics such as reverse mortgages, pre-purchase decisions or foreclosures and delinquencies. Providing these services require a lot of resources and itâ€™s important to accommodate for the populations that are in need (by state). We've created a user-friendly interactive dashboard that will predict the level of engagement towards HUD services at the U.S. state level. The goal is for HUD to reference the dashboard to gauge a better understanding of regional needs associated to housing issues in order to allocate personnel and monetary resources even more effectively.

### How we achieved this:
We firstly made an index that represented a combination of chosen predictors that represented housing affordability and economic health --> This was forecasted using a VAR model for each state --> Comparison of current vs forecasted index indicates the future demand of a service.

### Recommendations and Conclusions
**Conclusion:** <br>
To explore the outcome of our predictions by state: https://public.tableau.com/views/hud_counseling_services/Navigation?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
<br> <br>
We had faced some limitations within the data collection and modelling processes. In regards to data collection, we sourced many data sets with varying formatting, time frames, and some not meeting our requirement for state-wide data. Modelling limitations were mostly because of the time constraint which meant that revising earlier steps wasn't that affordable. The dashboard that we've created is an indicator of regional demand for deliquency and pre-purchase HUD services and will hopefully increase accessibility for U.S citizens in need.


**Recommendations:** <br>
- Improve the interpretability of the indices to quantify how much more or less citizens will need assistance in a given state.
<br>
- Aim is for HUD to reference this dashboard and predictive model to proactively address problems that American homeowners and homebuyers have by effectively re-allocating personnel and monetary resources.
