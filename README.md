# My-Projects

# Capstone Project

**Objective**: To reduce the extensive time and costs required for the research behind drug-drug interactions using Deep Learning Neural Networks.

- Taught myself unfamiliar mathematical, machine learning and biochemical concepts.
- Investigated novel methodologies within the problem space.
- Hosted an SQL server to interact with big data.

# Project 5

**Type**: Group Project

**Objective**: To consult the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) so that they can effectively increase accessibility for their counselling programs for those who seek guidance on housing affordability issues.

- Formulated and forecasted an index to represent decreased housing affordability based on housing activity and economic health indicators.
- Visualised state specific forecasts using a Tableau dashboard.
- Pulled data from various sources.
- Tech Stack: Tableau, VARS, API.

# Project 3

**Type**: Solo Concept Project

**Objective**: Create a model that is able to discern the language between subreddits r/LifeProTips and r/godtiersuperpowers posts which contain a redditor's genuine advice or superpower fantasy.

- Pulled 3000+ posts from subreddits using the Accessing Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).
- Applied natural language processing and machine learning using 3 different classification models.
- Optimised models to obtain their highest predictive power.
- Tech Stack: nltk, API, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

# Project 2

**Type**: Solo Concept Project

**Objective**: Identify the most valuable renovatable features of a house based in Ames, IA.

- Applied machine learning and trialled models (OLS, lasso and ridge regression) for inference.
- Tech Stack: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

# Project 1

**Type**: Solo Concept Project

**Objective**: Develop a more personalized SAT target for students by describing the extra effort required against peers within their 'intended major' cohorts and state to get into a 'prestigious' school.

- Applied data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering and visualization skills.
- Tech Stack: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
