# Overview

## Translating Natural Text â†’ SQL Queries to Fetch Data

*Application Development*

**Objective**: Increase accessibility of stored data (in postgres database). Use case is for doctors to retrieve patient data using natural language.

**Tech Stack:** LLMs, Open Source, SQL, AWS, Transformers, HuggingFace, Prompt Engineering

- LLM open-source model development, deployment (AWS SageMaker), HuggingFace, OpenAI API wrappers.
- Leveraged contemporary AI research to support the choice of model and other aspects of app development.


## Predicting DDIs

*Capstone Project*

**Objective**: To reduce the extensive time and costs required for the research behind drug-drug interactions using Deep Learning Neural Networks.

**Tech Stack:** Keras/ Tensorflow, Neural Network Architectures, Graphs, Similarity Scores, Tokekenisers, SQL

- Taught myself unfamiliar mathematical, machine learning and biochemical concepts.
- Investigated novel methodologies within the problem space.
- Hosted an SQL server to interact with big data.

## Project 5

*Group Project*

**Objective**: To consult the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) so that they can effectively increase accessibility for their counselling programs for those who seek guidance on housing affordability issues.

**Tech Stack:** Tableau, Time-Series Forecast (VAR), API, Macro Economics, Indexes 


- Formulated and forecasted an index to represent decreased housing affordability based on housing activity and economic health indicators.
- Visualised state specific forecasts using a Tableau dashboard.
- Pulled data from various sources.

## Project 3

*Solo Concept Project*

**Objective**: Create a model that is able to discern the language between subreddits r/LifeProTips and r/godtiersuperpowers posts which contain a redditor's genuine advice or superpower fantasy.

**Tech Stack:** NLTK, API, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn


- Pulled 3000+ posts from subreddits using the Accessing Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).
- Applied natural language processing and machine learning using 3 different classification models.
- Optimised models to obtain their highest predictive power.

## Project 2

*Solo Concept Project*

**Objective**: Identify the most valuable renovatable features of a house based in Ames, IA.

**Tech Stack:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

- Applied machine learning and trialled models (OLS, lasso and ridge regression) for inference.

## Project 1

*Solo Concept Project*

**Objective**: Develop a more personalized SAT target for students by describing the extra effort required against peers within their 'intended major' cohorts and state to get into a 'prestigious' school.

**Tech Stack:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

- Applied data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering and visualization skills.
